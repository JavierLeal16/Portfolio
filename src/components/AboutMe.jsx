      <p>
        Hello! I'm Javier Leal, a passionate Full Stack Developer with a knack
        for creating dynamic and responsive web applications. With a strong
        foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, I thrive on
        transforming ideas into functional digital experiences. My expertise
        includes JavaScript, React, Node.js, and databases like MongoDB and SQL.
        I enjoy learning about new technologies and strive to continually hone
        my skills as a developer and engineer. Whenever I'm not coding, I love
        exploring new tech trends, learning new design patterns and programming
        languages. <strong>Let's build something amazing together!</strong>
